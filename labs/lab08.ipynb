Unfortunately, this code was sloppily written and several bugs were introduced during its composition.  Your goal is to identify and correct all of those bugs.  You will have 15 minutes (timed) to work on identifying and fixing bugs alone, and then 5 minutes with a team of three students to finish it up.  The TA then has 5 minutes to clear up any questions that arose.  After the first code (total twenty-five minutes), we will repeat this with a different code for the same times.\n",
